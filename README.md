The "ID Card Generator" project is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate the efficient creation of customized identification cards for participants or members. Its primary objective is to provide organizers with a user-friendly platform that offers flexibility and control over the ID card creation process. The system boasts several key features, including predefined templates with placeholders for participant details such as name, college, or team name. Users have the option to customize these templates interactively, adjusting text position, color, and font family to suit their preferences. One of the standout features is the live preview functionality, which allows users to visualize real-time changes and ensure the final output meets their expectations before generating a print-ready version. However, the project also tackles several challenges, such as developing an intuitive interface that strikes the right balance between simplicity and customization options. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy of the live preview poses a significant challenge, especially when considering custom text colors and font choices. Despite these challenges, the project aims to deliver a seamless user experience and high-quality output, adhering to evaluation criteria that emphasize functionality, user experience, performance, and output quality.
